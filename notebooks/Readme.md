These notebooks are altered versions of the Keras examples which use Convolutional networks: 1D, 2D, 3D and LSTM2D.

Each has been tuned to run well, and has a version which uses WedgeDropout added on. Some networks have a simple yes/no flag when making the model, but most have separate sections with copied code for WedgeDropout.
